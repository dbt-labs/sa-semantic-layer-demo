### Tenets to keep in mind 
- A metric value should be consistent everywhere that it is referenced
- We prefer generalized metrics with many dimensions over specific metrics with few dimensions
- It should be easier to use dbtâ€™s metrics than it is to avoid them
- Organization and discoverability are as important as precision
- One-off models built to power metrics are an anti-pattern
